<p class="pf">Two-thousand copies of <span class="it">Walden, or Life in the Woods</span> were first published in Boston by Ticknor and Fields, Aug. 1854. The work received generally favorable reviews but sold slowly. This edition was prepared for students at the City University of New York. It is offered under a Creative Commons license under which the edition may freely read, shared, and edited.</p>
<p>The text of this ebook edition is based on Project Gutenberg files and scans of the first edition held by the Smithsonian Libraries, available on Archive.Org. While every effort has been made to ensure that the text is reproduced faithfully, this edition is no substitute for an authoritative edition.
